Number-Guessing Game
--------------------
A simple game where the computer picks a number and the player must guess what it is.

This app is mostly meant for me to learn Android dev with while I follow along with Udacity's [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) course. I'm still building Sunshine of course but a little extra practice never hurt :) I'd appreciate any tips/tricks on how I could improve this app as really I'm doing what I can with what I pick up from the course/Android documentation/StackOverflow, and I'm sure there are better ways of accomplishing this.
